name: legacy-gh-pages (disabled)

# This workflow has been replaced by `.github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml` which
# uses the official `upload-pages-artifact` and `deploy-pages` actions.
# Keep this file present but disabled for traceability. Do not enable.

# The original 'on: [none]' is invalid YAML for Actions and causes a
# repository-level workflow validation error. To retain the file for
# traceability but keep it effectively disabled, expose a manual trigger
# and include a no-op job guarded by `if: false` so it never runs.
