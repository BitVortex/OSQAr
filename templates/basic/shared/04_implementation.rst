Implementation
==============

This scaffold intentionally keeps the implementation minimal.

Typical starting layout:

- ``src/``: implementation sources
- ``tests/``: tests
- ``include/``: public headers (common for C/C++)

Replace the placeholder code with your real component implementation and keep the docs and trace links up to date.
