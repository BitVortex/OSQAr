OSQAr Shared C Library
======================

This example is a tiny OSQAr-qualified C library that is used by multiple other examples.

It exists to demonstrate a common integrator scenario:

- multiple qualified libraries / components depend on the same qualified library
- the workspace contains the dependency shipment only once (logical dedup)

Verification
------------

JUnit test results are generated by ``./build-and-test.sh test`` and imported into the docs.

.. literalinclude:: test_results.xml
