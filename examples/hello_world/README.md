# OSQAr Example: Temperature Monitor (TSIM) (Legacy Python)

This example demonstrates the core capabilities of OSQAr through a simple, domain-agnostic temperature monitoring component.

**The contents of this example have been fully generated by LLMs. It shall only serve as a reference on how a toolchain setup could look like.**

## Overview

**Component**: Thermal Sensor Interface Module  
**Purpose**: Monitor temperature and report safe/unsafe states  
**Domain**: Generic (applicable to medical devices, industrial machinery, automotive, robotics, etc.)

## What This Example Shows

1. **Requirements Traceability**: Safety requirements linked to functional and design specifications
2. **ISO 26262 Compliance**: Structured requirement IDs, traceability matrices, and verification mapping
3. **Architecture Documentation**: System diagrams with PlantUML
4. **Test Mapping**: Requirements traced to test cases for verification
5. **Optional Complexity Report**: Cyclomatic complexity report via `lizard`

- `diagrams/` - PlantUML architecture diagrams

## Building the Example

```bash
# from the repository root
poetry install
poetry run sphinx-build -b html examples/hello_world _build/html/examples/python
open _build/html/examples/python/index.html
```

## Key Takeaways

- Requirements use structured IDs: `REQ_SAFETY_*`, `REQ_FUNC_*`, `ARCH_*`, `TEST_*`
- Each requirement links upstream/downstream for traceability
- Architecture diagrams show component boundaries and data flow
- Test cases are mapped to requirements for compliance verification
