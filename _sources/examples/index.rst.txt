OSQAr Examples
==============

This page links to the published reference examples.

Language-specific examples (published under ``/examples/``):

- `C <c/>`_
- `C++ <cpp/>`_
- `Rust <rust/>`_
- `Python (workstation demo) <python/>`_

Notes
-----

- These examples are separate Sphinx projects that get published into subfolders.
- For safety-related embedded projects, prefer **C** or **Rust**.
- **C++** is widely used in industry, but is not recommended here as a starting point for safety-related embedded work.
- The **Python** example is an easy-to-run workstation demo of the traceability workflow, not an embedded implementation.
- If you are building locally, enter an example directory and run its ``build-and-test.sh``.
